                    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        <h2>The Developer Behind Rusty Degen</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Hello! I'm a passionate Rust player with over 7,000 hours in the game. What started as a hobby quickly turned into an obsession, and I've experienced every aspect of the Rust ecosystem - from intense PvP battles to trading rare skins.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">As a computer science student, I wanted to combine my two passions: programming and Rust. Rusty Degen is the result of this combination - a solo project developed from the ground up as part of my advanced computer science coursework.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Unlike many gambling platforms that are run by large teams with significant backing, Rusty Degen is entirely developed, maintained, and operated by a single person - me. This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world application while creating something for a community I deeply care about.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        <h2>My Journey</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">My journey with Rust began in 2018, and I quickly fell in love with the game's unforgiving nature and vibrant community. As I accumulated thousands of hours in-game, I also became fascinated with the skin economy that had developed around it.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">When it came time to choose a project for my advanced computer science studies, I knew I wanted to create something that would challenge me technically while connecting to something I was passionate about. Building a provably fair jackpot system seemed like the perfect challenge - it would require implementing secure cryptographic systems, real-time multiplayer functionality, integration with Steam's API, and creating an engaging user experience.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Every aspect of Rusty Degen - from the backend infrastructure to the frontend animations - has been meticulously crafted by me. This solo development approach means updates might come a bit slower than on larger platforms, but it also ensures that every feature is implemented with care and attention to detail.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        <h2>Community Focus</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Being a Rust player myself, I've designed Rusty Degen with the community in mind. I understand the concerns players have about fairness and transparency in skin gambling, which is why I've made the provably fair system a central feature of the platform.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I'm always open to feedback and suggestions from the community. As both the developer and a fellow player, I want to create the kind of platform that I would want to use myself - one that's fair, transparent, and fun.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for being part of this journey. Whether you're here to try your luck in the jackpot or just checking out what a solo developer can build, I appreciate your support!</p>

                                   <p>Rusty Degen is a Rust skin jackpot site where players can deposit their skins into a pool. When the timer runs out, a winner is randomly selected using our Provably Fair system. The winner takes all skins in the pot (minus a small site fee). Your chance of winning is proportional to the value of skins you've deposited compared to the total pot value.</p>

                                   <p>First, log in with your Steam account using the "Sign in" button. Then click the "Deposit Skins" button. A modal window will show your available Rust inventory. Select the skins you wish to deposit (ensure they meet the minimum value requirements) and click the final "Deposit Items" button. You'll then receive instructions to send a Steam trade offer to our bot including a specific message/token. You must accept/send this trade offer within Steam to complete the deposit.</p>

                               <div class="faq-answer">
                                   <p>The winner is selected using a provably fair system based on cryptographic hashing. Each player gets virtual 'tickets' proportional to the value of their deposited skins (e.g., 1 ticket per $0.01). A random winning ticket number is generated using a combination of a secret server seed (hashed and shown before the round starts) and a public client seed (based on round info). See our "Provably Fair" page for a detailed explanation and verification tool.</p>

                                   <p>If you win the jackpot, all items in the pot (minus the site fee) will be automatically sent to you via a Steam trade offer from one of our site bots. Ensure your Trade URL is correctly set in your profile (you'll be prompted if it's missing) and that your Steam inventory privacy is set to "Public" so we can send the offer.</p>

                                   <p>Yes, the minimum value for a single deposit transaction is typically $1.00 (this may be subject to change). Individual items below a certain threshold might also be excluded. The total value of items you select must meet the minimum deposit requirement.</p>

                                <p>Rusty Degen uses a provably fair system to ensure complete transparency and fairness in winner selection. Our system uses cryptographic methods (specifically SHA256 hashing) to guarantee that the results cannot be manipulated by the site operators and can be independently verified by anyone after the round concludes.</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Seed Generation:</strong> Before a round begins, the server generates a long, random, secret string called the "Server Seed".</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> The server calculates the SHA256 hash of this Server Seed. This hash (e.g., <code>a1b2c3d4...</code>) is publicly displayed for the round *before* any deposits are accepted. Hashing is a one-way process; you cannot get the original Seed from the Hash, but you can later verify that a revealed Seed produces the same Hash.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deposits & Tickets:</strong> Players deposit items. Each $0.01 of value deposited grants the player 1 ticket. Tickets are numbered sequentially (e.g., Player A deposits $1.00 gets tickets 1-100, Player B deposits $2.50 gets tickets 101-350).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Round End & Client Seed:</strong> When the round ends (timer reaches zero or max items), a "Client Seed" is determined. This is typically a combination of public data like the Round ID and the end timestamp, making it unique and unpredictable beforehand.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Combined Hashing:</strong> The server combines the secret Server Seed and the public Client Seed (usually as <code>ServerSeed-ClientSeed</code>). It then calculates the SHA256 hash of this combined string.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Winning Ticket Calculation:</strong> The resulting hash is converted into a number. We use the modulo operator (%) with the total number of tickets in the round to determine the winning ticket number. (e.g., <code>WinningTicket = HashedNumber % TotalTickets + 1</code> to get 1-based ticket).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Winner Selection:</strong> The player whose ticket range includes the calculated Winning Ticket number wins the pot.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Seed Reveal:</strong> After the winner is determined and announced, the original secret Server Seed for that round is revealed publicly.</li>
