                            <p>Welcome! I'm the sole developer behind Rusty Degen, and also a dedicated Rust player with over 7,000 hours logged. This game isn't just code to me; it's a passion.</p>
                            <p>As a computer science student, Rusty Degen became my advanced project – a way to merge my programming skills with my love for the Rust universe and its unique skin economy. This platform was built entirely from scratch by me.</p>
                            <p>Being a solo operation means development might proceed at a different pace than larger sites, but it guarantees that every feature is built with personal care and a player's perspective. This project is a testament to applying academic learning to create something tangible for a community I'm proud to be part of.</p>

                        <div class="fair-content">
                            <p>My Rust journey started back in 2018. The game's challenging nature and the intricate skin market quickly captured my interest.</p>
                            <p>Choosing a project for my studies, I wanted a significant technical challenge connected to my passion. A provably fair jackpot site fit perfectly, involving secure cryptography, real-time interactions, Steam API integration, and engaging frontend design.</p>
                            <p>From the backend logic to the frontend visuals you see, every part of Rusty Degen is my own work. It's been a challenging but rewarding process.</p>

                            <p>As a player, I understand the importance of trust and transparency, especially in skin gambling. That's why the provably fair system is fundamental to Rusty Degen, ensuring outcomes are verifiable and not manipulated.</p>
                            <p>I value community feedback immensely. My goal is to build a platform that I, as a player, would trust and enjoy. Your suggestions help shape the future of Rusty Degen.</p>

                            <p>Rusty Degen is a Rust skin jackpot site where players deposit skins into a communal pot. When the round concludes (usually via a timer), one participant is chosen randomly through our Provably Fair system to win all the skins in the pot, minus a small site commission. Your probability of winning directly corresponds to the value of your deposited skins relative to the total pot value.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Begin by logging in via Steam. Click "Deposit Skins" to open a modal displaying your Rust inventory. Choose the items you wish to deposit (meeting any minimum value criteria) and confirm. You will then be guided to send a Steam trade offer to our designated bot, ensuring you include the unique code provided in the trade message. Your deposit is credited once this trade offer is successfully completed.</p>

                         <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Winner selection relies on our provably fair cryptographic system. Every $0.01 deposited grants a player virtual "tickets". A secure Server Seed (hashed publicly before the round, revealed after) and a public Client Seed (derived from round data) are combined and hashed (SHA256). This final hash determines a winning ticket number within the total range of tickets issued for the round. The owner of that ticket wins. Visit the "Provably Fair" page for full details and the verification tool.</p>

                            <p>If you win, the items constituting the pot (after the site's commission is deducted) are automatically sent via a Steam trade offer from our bot to the Trade URL registered in your Rusty Degen profile. To ensure successful delivery, please verify your Trade URL is accurate and that your Steam inventory privacy is set to "Public".</p>

                            <p>Yes, there's typically a minimum total value required for each deposit transaction (e.g., $1.00, subject to change). Additionally, individual items might need to meet a specific minimum value to be accepted. The deposit interface will indicate if your selected items meet the necessary criteria.</p>

                            <p>Rusty Degen applies a small commission (usually between 5-10%) to each jackpot pot. This fee is crucial for covering operational expenses like server hosting, bot upkeep, ongoing development, and ensuring the platform's sustainability and improvement.</p>

                            <p>Should you be determined as the winner of a jackpot round according to our Provably Fair system, Rusty Degen will initiate an automated Steam trade offer to deliver the applicable virtual items (the pot contents less any site commission/tax) to your designated Steam Trade URL.</p>
                            <p>Successful delivery of winnings is contingent upon your fulfillment of the following responsibilities:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ensuring the Steam Trade URL provided in your Rusty Degen profile is accurate, complete, and currently active *prior* to round completion.</li>
                                <li>Maintaining your Steam inventory privacy settings as "Public" to permit incoming trade offers from our system.</li>
                                <li>Promptly accepting the legitimate trade offer sent by our designated bot(s) within a reasonable timeframe (typically 24-48 hours, though this period may be adjusted at our discretion).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Failure to meet these requirements may result in the forfeiture of winnings. Rusty Degen assumes no responsibility or liability for winnings that cannot be delivered due to: an incorrect or outdated Trade URL, restrictive inventory privacy settings, non-acceptance of the trade offer within the allocated time, or any restrictions, bans, or limitations associated with the user's Steam account. If you experience legitimate issues receiving a payout despite meeting all criteria, contact support promptly (ideally within 12 hours of the round's conclusion).</p>
