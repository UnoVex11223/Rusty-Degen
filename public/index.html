                            <h3>What is RustyDegen?</h3>
                            <p>RustyDegen is a CS2 skin gambling platform where players can deposit their skins into a collective pot. Once the timer ends or the pot reaches its maximum value, a winner is randomly selected based on the percentage of the pot they contributed.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>How does the jackpot work?</h3>
                            <p>Players deposit skins into the current round. Each skin has a monetary value that determines your percentage chance of winning. For example, if you deposit $100 worth of skins into a $1,000 pot, you have a 10% chance of winning the entire pot (minus our small commission).</p>

                            <p>Absolutely! We use a provably fair system that ensures complete transparency and fairness in determining winners. You can verify each round's results using our provably fair system, which combines server seed, client seed, and round data to generate a random number between 0 and 1.</p>

                            <p>The deposit process is straightforward and secure. First, sign in with your Steam account and navigate to the Deposit tab. Browse your inventory and select the skins you'd like to contribute to the current jackpot round. Review your selections and confirm your deposit when ready. Our automated system will send you a trade offer through Steam that you'll need to accept to finalize the transaction. Once accepted, your skins will be added to the current round and your chance percentage will be calculated based on their value.</p>
